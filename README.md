# Auto-generated Node.js application, improved

This is an application created with the [Express application generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) and improved according to the [NODE.JS  best practices](https://github.com/i0natan/nodebestpractices).

## Generation options

Default. Which at the moment of writing means _jade_ view engine and plain CSS styling.

## Good things out of the box

 - logging
 - bin/www
 - server port is taken from the ENV
 - error page

## Changes made
 - node-dev for auto-restarts
 - structure by components
 - automatic tests with mocha and supertest
